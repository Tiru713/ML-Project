Explainable Data-Driven Digital Twin for Predicting Battery States in Electric Vehicles
This project implements a data-driven digital twin (DT) framework designed to accurately and transparently predict the battery states of electric vehicles (EVs), including State of Charge (SOC), State of Health (SOH), and Remaining Useful Life (RUL). Our approach emphasizes explainability to ensure predictions are interpretable, trustworthy, and suitable for real-world deployment.

🚗 Overview
Battery degradation is one of the critical challenges in EVs. A digital twin—serving as a virtual replica of the battery system—can help monitor and predict battery conditions in real-time. Unlike physics-based models, this data-driven twin leverages historical and real-time sensor data to learn complex patterns and make intelligent forecasts.

🔍 Key Features
📊 Data-Driven Modeling: Utilizes machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost, LSTM, or Random Forests to model battery behavior from data.

🧠 Explainable AI (XAI): Integrates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME to interpret model predictions and understand feature contributions.

🔧 Real-Time Monitoring: Designed for potential integration with onboard EV systems for live battery diagnostics.

📈 Predictive Analytics: Accurately forecasts SOC, SOH, and RUL, enhancing battery safety, maintenance planning, and energy optimization.

⚙️ Modular & Scalable: Built with a flexible architecture to support various battery types and data sources.
